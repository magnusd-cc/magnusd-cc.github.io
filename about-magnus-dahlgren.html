    <h1>Hello, I am Magnus Dahlgren</h1>
<p><img alt="Magnus Dahlgren" src="about-magnus-dahlgren.jpg" /></p>
<p>I’m a freelance Scrum Master and Agile Coach based in London, United Kingdom.</p>
<p>I started out as a software developer but have been working as a Scrum Master and Agile Coach in some shape or form for the past 12 years. I love helping teams deliver awesome products, supporting them and those around them in finding approaches and ways of working that work for <em>them</em>.</p>
<h2>How I can help you</h2>
<p>Through my company, <em>Magnus Dahlgren Enterprises</em>, I’m available on a short-term freelance basis to help you make the most of agile. </p>
<h3>Agile coaching of teams and individuals</h3>
<p>Agile processes is not something that’s “owned” by a coach or a Scrum Master, and throughout my agile career, my focus has been on helping teams find their own solutions. Using experiences and insights from more than than a decade working with agile teams using Scrum and Kanban, I can provide the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coaching</strong> of teams and individuals, helping them find solutions to their own problems and moving beyond “doing agile”, as a list of practices, to <em>being</em> agile, with the shift in mindset it requires.</li>
<li><strong>Mentoring</strong>, for example guiding new Scrum Masters as they learn their new role</li>
<li><strong>Facilitation</strong> of various events, as described below</li>
<li><strong>Teaching</strong>, introducing various agile concepts and techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact me on  <a href="mailto:me@magnusd.cc">me@magnusd.cc</a>  to discuss how I can help you.</p>
<h3>One-off facilitation of workshops, Scrum events and other sessions</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why it can be a good idea to bring in an external facilitator for a meeting or workshop. Not only is an experienced and neutral facilitator a way to increase the chances of achieving the desired outcomes. It also frees up everyone else up take active part in the session and can be an opportunity to observe how to run the session, so that it can be run by someone internal next time.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have run countless workshops and meetings and I can help you facilitate pretty much any session, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team initiations / kick-offs</li>
<li>Sprint or project retrospectives</li>
<li>Brainstorming</li>
<li>Story mapping</li>
<li>Troubleshooting</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact me on  <a href="mailto:me@magnusd.cc">me@magnusd.cc</a>  to find out more.</p>
<h2>What I’ve done so far</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>MyDrive Solutions</strong> (since 2018). In my current role as agile coach, I support several teams and am building an Agile Community of Practice.</li>
<li><strong>Hive</strong> (2017 - 2018). Scrum Master on a contract basis. Initiated a new team in a new product area and helped them become a productive and jelled team despite being spread across 4 timezones.</li>
<li><strong>BBC</strong> (2010 - 2017). I had the pleasure of working with several different teams around the corporation, delivering services that millions of users care very passionately about.</li>
<li><strong>Ominor Ltd</strong> (2007 - 2010). I learned a lot during my journey at this e-commerce agency, starting as a scrum master and ending up as a product owner.</li>
<li><strong>Pilotfish Networks</strong> (2004 - 2007). My first real job was as a Java developer back in my native Sweden. After a couple of years, I became a project manager and gained my Certified Scrum Master in 2007.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My qualifications</h2>
<p>I love learning. On top of my own experiences, I have gained a wide range of certifications, learning from some of the best and most experienced agilists out there.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Certified Scrum Master – CSM</strong> (since 2007, longer than 95% of other CSMs) </li>
<li><strong>Certified Scrum Professional – CSP-SM</strong> (only 1% of CSMs hold this certification) </li>
<li><strong>LeSS Practitioner</strong> – Large Scale Scrum</li>
<li><strong>Coaching Agile Transitions</strong> – ICAgile Certified Professional – ICP-CAT</li>
<li><strong>Agility in the Enterprise</strong> – ICAgile Certified Professional – ICP-ENT</li>
<li><strong>Agile Coaching</strong> – ICAgile Certified Professional – ICP-ACC</li>
<li><strong>Agile Team Facilitation</strong> – ICAgile Certified Professional – ICP-ATF</li>
<li><strong>Lean Facilitator</strong> – LCS Level 1b</li>
</ul>
<p>… and my technical understanding is underpinned by a <strong>Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering</strong> (MSc)</p>
