            <h2>Turn night into day with a lightbulb!</h2>

            <p>
                Are you struggling to see what's really going on in your team? You are not alone. 
                A recent survey found that several people often find themselves in the dark. But it
                doesn't have to be this way! With a lightbulb, you can make almost any room brighter.
