    <h1>Some of my older blog posts, republished</h1>
<p><img alt="Recycling symbol" src="018-older-blogposts.jpg" /></p>
<p>Before starting this latest incarnation of my blog, I was blogging in a couple of different places. Judging from the traffic, some of those posts still seem valuable to people so I’ve decided to move them here. That way, they won’t disappear when I shut down my older sites.</p>
<p>Rather than rewriting them as I would have using my most current lens, I’ve decided to just post them as-is. So, withour further ado, here are some older posts of mine...</p>


<h2>Scrum &amp; agile in general</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="processes-and-tools-not-enemies-of-agile.html">Processes and tools are not enemies of Agile</a></strong>
<br>There is no continuum with “Individuals and interactions” on one side and “Processes and tools” on the other. You can’t choose one over the other. Outcomes require action!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="5-things-ive-learned-about-scrum-the-hard-way.html">5 things I’ve learned about Scrum the hard way</a></strong>
<br>My agile journey has been an educational one and in this blog post from a few years ago, I listed a few things had found out by then.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="5-situations-scrum-may-not-best-choice.html">5 situations when Scrum may not be your best choice</a></strong>
<br>I love Scrum but it shouldn't be a surprise that there are situations where it’s not very useful. That doesn’t mean Scrum is broken.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scrum Masters</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="continuous-improvement-success-scrum-master.html">Continuous improvement is what success as a Scrum Master is all about</a></strong>
<br>It doesn’t matter all that much where the team is today. They can be incredibly productive or get barely anything done at all but as long as they get steadily better over time, I’d say the Scrum Master is doing a good job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="seven-sins-of-a-scrum-master.html">Seven sins of a Scrum Master</a></strong>
<br>A bad Scrum Master can derail everything. In this article, I look at seven bad characteristics or behaviours of Scrum Masters I have witnessed. Or even shown myself!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="better-name-for-scrum-master.html">A better name for Scrum Master?</a></strong>
<br>Does it matter that we call Scrum Masters Scrum Masters? Probably not, but maybe another name could describe better what we do? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools and techniques</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="self-selecting-teams-on-a-small-scale.html">Self-selecting teams on a small scale</a></strong>
<br>Self-selection is usually associated used in large scale agile implementations but how about using it on a much smaller scale? In this post, I describe my experience from using it with just two Scrum teams. Spoiler alert: it worked great!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="is-your-daily-stand-up-daily-waste-of-time.html">Is your daily stand-up a daily waste of time?</a></strong>
<br>If your stand-up feels like a waste of time, it probably is! Here are some things to look out for and some experiments to try to make it better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="7-reasons-why-some-stories-arent-useful-stories.html">7 reasons some user stories aren’t useful stories</a></strong>
<br>Unsurprisingly, simply writing a sentence on the format “As a x, I want to y, so that z” won’t make it a user story. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Estimation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="quick-way-to-estimate-whole-backlog.html">A quick way to estimate a whole product backlog</a></strong>
<br>I’ve been using this method many times over the years. Spending more time and effort on estimating something doesn’t necessarily lead to better estimates!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="noestimates-just-story-points-done-right.html">#noestimates is just story points done right</a></strong>
<br>Story points work well for many teams but are not without challenges. Is it really that big of a step to get rid of them? </p>
</li>
</ul>
